Navigate to: `src/components/generated/MainContentArea.tsx`

#### Step 2: Find the Attractions Array
Look for this section around line 89:
```typescript
const attractions: Attraction[] = [{
```

#### Step 3: Update Information
Each attraction follows this format:
```typescript
{
  id: '1',                    // Keep existing ID
  name: 'Stone Zoo',          // UPDATE: Attraction name
  category: 'Family',         // UPDATE: Family, Nature, Historic, Recreation, Arts
  rating: 4.5,               // UPDATE: Rating out of 5.0
  image: 'zoo',              // KEEP: Used for internal reference
  description: 'Home to over 100 species of animals',  // UPDATE: Brief description
  address: '149 Pond St, Stoneham, MA',               // UPDATE: Full address
  url: 'https://www.zoonewengland.org/stone-zoo/'     // OPTIONAL: Website URL
}
```

#### Step 4: Common Updates

**Updating a Website URL**:
```typescript
// Find the attraction and update the url field
url: 'https://www.newwebsite.com'

// To remove a website URL:
// Delete the entire url line
```

**Updating Description**:
```typescript
// Keep descriptions under 100 words, focus on key features
description: 'Beautiful reservoir perfect for walking and fishing with scenic trails'
```

**Updating Rating**:
```typescript
// Use ratings from 3.5 to 5.0, increments of 0.1
rating: 4.3
```

**Changing Category**:
```typescript
// Available categories:
category: 'Family'      // Zoo, family-friendly venues
category: 'Nature'      // Outdoor spaces, ponds, hiking
category: 'Historic'    // Historical sites and landmarks  
category: 'Recreation'  // Sports facilities, pools, golf
category: 'Arts'        // Theater, cultural venues
```

### Adding New Attractions

#### Step 1: Choose the Next Available ID
Look at the last attraction in the array and use the next number:
```typescript
// If last attraction has id: '9', use id: '10'
id: '10'
```

#### Step 2: Add New Entry
Add a comma after the last attraction, then add:
```typescript
}, {  // Don't forget this comma and opening brace
  id: '10',
  name: 'New Attraction Name',
  category: 'Recreation',
  rating: 4.5,
  image: 'placeholder',
  description: 'Brief description of what makes this attraction special',
  address: 'Full Street Address, Stoneham, MA',
  url: 'https://website.com'  // Optional - remove if no website
}]   // Don't forget the closing brace and bracket
```

#### Step 3: Verify Syntax
Make sure you have:
- Comma after previous attraction
- All required fields filled in
- Proper quotes around strings
- No extra commas at the end

### Removing Attractions

#### Option 1: Complete Removal
Delete the entire attraction object including commas.

#### Option 2: Mark as Inactive (Recommended)
Add a comment and keep for reference:

// {
//   id: '5',
//   name: 'Closed Attraction',
//   ...
// },
```
